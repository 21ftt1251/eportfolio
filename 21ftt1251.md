```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/laravel
```

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name wafihakim.tech;
    root /var/www/laravel/public;

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

    error_page 404 /index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

- Save the changes by pressing `CTRL + x` then press `y` to save and simply exit by pressing `enter`

4. Next, activate the new virtual host configuration file:

```sh
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/laravel /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

5. Confirm that the configuration doesn't contain any syntax errors:

```sh
sudo nginx -t
```

```
Output
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```
